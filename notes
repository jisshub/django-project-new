Linking multiple pages in django
----------------------------------------------

set a name for app in urls.py

to avoid the conflicts b/w each apps v specify appname.

eg: if have same view func in multiple apps.
so to avoid v points to the app before pointing to view func.
thus it becomes specific to that app.


set name atribut for each urls


in base.html
---------------

for each href,

change deafult value to
{% url 'course_app:index' %}


v links to the index view.
course_app is the app name set in urls.py in app dir
